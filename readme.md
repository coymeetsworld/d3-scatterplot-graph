# D3 Scatterplot Graph

## Description

This project uses d3.js to display a scatterplot of the 35 fastest times up Alpe d'Huez normalized to 13.8km distance. It displays each cyclist with a red or green plot point. A red plot point indicates the cyclist was caught doping at some point in the career while green means they have not.

When a user places the cursor over one of the plot points a tooltip will be displayed indicating the year and recorded time of the cyclist. If the plot point is red it will also provide a brief description on the cyclist's doping infraction.
